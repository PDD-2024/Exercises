You're developing a game that needs to display messages in different languages (English, Spanish, French). 
Currently, the code has message strings hardcoded throughout the application and uses if-else statements 
to select languages. This makes it difficult to:
1. Add new languages
2. Maintain message translations
3. Switch languages at runtime
4. Test different language implementations

Design and implement a solution using the Factory Pattern.
